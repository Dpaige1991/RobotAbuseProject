# RobotAbuseProject

In order for this project to work, you must open the scenes folder and open the "RobotAbuseScene".
Afterwards you will see the robot and will be able to test the project.

You can drag around the robot arms by hoving and holding the mouse over the arms of the robots.
The message on the upper left corner shows the message if the robot arm is attached or deattached.

If you go to the window menu, you should see the test menu where you can test the project.
